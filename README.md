<h1>Practice problems</h1>

You don’t need to turn in solutions to the following textbook problems, but you should try all of them.

Section 1.1: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9

Section 1.2: 8, 11, 14, 18, 24, 27

<h1>Problems</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Suppose <em>n </em>∈ Z. Let <em>r </em>be the remainder when <em>n</em><sup>2 </sup>is divided by 8. What are the possible values of <em>r</em>? (You must prove both that your list contains all possible values and that it does not contain any impossible values – otherwise you could just say that the list 0<em>,</em>1<em>,…,</em>7 definitely contains all the possibilities!)</li>

 <li>Suppose <em>a,b </em>∈ Z with <em>b &gt; </em> Let <em>r </em>be the remainder when <em>a </em>is divided by <em>b</em>. Prove that (<em>a,b</em>) = (<em>b,r</em>).</li>

 <li>If <em>a,b,c </em>are nonzero integers, let (<em>a,b,c</em>) denote the greatest common divisor of <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>. [That is, (<em>a,b,c</em>) is the greatest integer which divides all of <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>.] Prove that (<em>a,b,c</em>) = ((<em>a,b</em>)<em>,c</em>).</li>

</ol>

<strong>Note: </strong>This means that if we have an efficient algorithm to compute the gcd of two integers, then we can efficiently compute the gcd of three integers by using the algorithm twice. In fact, there is such an algorithm, as we’ll see later.

<ol start="4">

 <li>Suppose <em>a,b,c </em>∈ Z such that <em>a </em>| <em>c </em>and <em>b </em>| <em>c</em>. Prove that <em>ab </em>| <em>c</em>(<em>a,b</em>).</li>

</ol>

<strong>Note: </strong>An especially important special case is when (<em>a,b</em>) = 1. In that case, the theorem says that if <em>a </em>| <em>c</em>, <em>b </em>| <em>c</em>, and (<em>a,b</em>) = 1, then <em>ab </em>| <em>c</em>.

<ol start="5">

 <li>Suppose <em>a,b,c </em>∈ Z such that (<em>a,c</em>) = (<em>b,c</em>) = 1. Prove that (<em>ab,c</em>) = 1.</li>
